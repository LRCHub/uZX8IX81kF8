Ooh, what are you thinking of?
Boy, what are you dreaming of? Anyway
I run around the streets to find you
Shout your name, I want to hold you

Ooh, what are you thinking of?
I run around the streets to find you
Shout your name, I want to hold you

I'll be there, to run into your arms.
I'll be there, won't you hug my soul?

Ooh, what are you thinking of?
Boy, you're thinking about my love, anyway
You're walking through my dreams at night
Losing all my appetite, oh no

What are you thinking of?
You're walking through my dreams at night

I'll be there, to run into your arms
I'll be there, baby, we're alright

I'll be there, to run into your arms
I'll be there, won't you hug my soul?
I'll be there, to run into your arms
I'll be there, baby, we're alright
