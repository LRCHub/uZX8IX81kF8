We're ready
What kind of skin
Skin is this
It ain't with your shovel that you miss
Zombie rocking time
A hundred years dead
The pages of the book said
Keep your mind to yourself
Keep your thoughts to yourself
Killing 'em off and what have you got
You got
Your thoughts on somebody else's shelf
Keep the door locked
Toes locked
Your tongue is tied and your writing is blocked
Zombie rock
Zombie rocking time

A hundred years of death and decay
It ends with a shovel and a rake
Zombie rocking time

Zombie Zombie Zombie
Zombie Zombie Zombie
Zombie Zombie Zombie
Zombie rocking time

It pays to listen to zombie rockin
But not to make the time
So wish someone would make them books on the shelf
Reading the book of the zombie dead
Told me not to worry
But the pages started to curl
And
Zombie rocking time
Again

Zombie Zombie Zombie
Zombie rocking time

Zombie Zombie Zombie
Zombie rocking time

Zombie Zombie Zombie
Zombie Zombie Zombie
Zombie Zombie Zombie Zombie
Zombie Zombie Zombie Zombie

Zombie rocking time
Zombie rocking time

Rose on socks
Lend a comb
Skin peeling off
Road Cone
Read the book
Nose cone

Zombie rock
Zombie rock

You'll shovel off
Shovel Off
Nose Cone
Zombie rock
